    <h3>About Devin</h3>
    <p>
      Devin Liu is a composer, producer, and performer whose work navigates the space between cinematic storytelling and emotionally immersive sound.
      Drawing from a background in classical piano and a deep connection to contemporary rock and metal, his music blends orchestral scale with modern
      sonic aesthetics — often balancing delicacy with intensity, structure with atmosphere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently based in London and studying at Guildhall School of Music & Drama, Devin’s work spans film scoring, game music, and live band performance.
      He approaches composition as a narrative craft — shaping musical arcs that serve emotion, whether through hybrid scoring techniques or collaborative
      arrangements in band settings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alongside his work in media, Devin is an active member of the bands <strong>Pillowman</strong> and <strong>Ostinato</strong>, where he serves as both
      producer and performer. These projects allow him to explore a more tactile, band-driven process, contributing to sound that draws from post-metal,
      progressive, and cinematic influences. Across both live and studio contexts, his focus remains on creating music that resonates with weight, intention,
      and movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Devin’s work also includes collaborations with independent artists and instrumentalists, providing arrangement, mixing, and compositional support
      across a range of genres. Whether working to picture, developing a concept EP, or shaping a moment in a live set, he’s drawn to music that builds
      a world around the listener — with narrative at its core.
